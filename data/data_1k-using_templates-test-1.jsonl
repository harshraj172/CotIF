(a) Using the law of cosines, show that the magnitude of the ball's velocity vector after it bounces is given by \\(v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}-2gh\\), where \\(h\\) is the ball's maximum height. (b) Using the law of sines, show that the angle of reflection (the angle at which the ball bounces) is equal to \\(\\theta\\), the angle of incidence."

To do this, the researcher wants to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in protein levels before and after the administration of the drug.\nThe sample size is small (n = 10), so the researcher decides to use the t-distribution to calculate the confidence interval. The degrees of freedom for the t-distribution is n-1 = 9. The critical value for the t-distribution with 9 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is approximately 2.262.\nCalculate the mean difference, the standard deviation of the differences, and the margin of error for the 95% confidence interval."

Using the same method, we can convert a base-5 number $234_5$ to base-10 as $2(5^2)+3(5^1)+4(5^0)$. Now, let's define a new base-$k$ number $pqrs_k$ such that $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ represent (base 10) positive integers. We will convert this base-$k$ number to base-10 by evaluating the expression $p(k^3)+q(k^2)+r(k^1)+s(k^0)$.\nGiven $k=6$, $p=3$, $q=2$, $r=4$, and $s=5$, what is the base-10 equivalent of the base-6 number $3245_6$?"

The problem is stated as follows:\n\nA neutral kaon, which has a mean lifetime of 52 picoseconds (ps), decays into a pion of type π+ with a momentum of 230 MeV/c in the rest frame of the kaon. We can find the energy of the Kaon, E, using the fact that it is decaying at rest, and using the properties of the π+ pion. The π+ pion has a mass of 139.6 MeV/c^2.\n\nCalculate the energy of the neutral kaon in MeV."
