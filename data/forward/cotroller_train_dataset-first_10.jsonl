Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, I know that converting a fraction to a decimal involves dividing the numerator by the denominator. In this case, the fraction is 3 over 1250. So maybe I can do the division 3 \u00f7 1250. But before jumping into long division, maybe there's a smarter way to simplify this or convert the denominator to a power of 10 to make it easier?\n\nWait, the denominator here is 1250. Let me break that down. 1250 is 125 times 10, right? And 125 is 5 cubed (5^3). So 1250 is 5^3 * 2 * 5, which is 5^4 * 2. Hmm, or maybe I should factor it as 1250 = 5^4 * 2. Let me confirm: 5^3 is 125, times 10 is 1250. So, 5^3 * 10 = 1250. Alternatively, 1250 = 125 * 10 = 5^3 * 2 * 5 = 5^4 * 2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, since the denominator is 5^4 * 2, to convert the fraction to a decimal, we might need to make the denominator a power of 10. Powers of 10 are multiples of 2 and 5. Since 1250 is 5^4 * 2, if we can get the denominator to be 10^4, we can have a decimal. Wait, but 10^4 is 10000. Let me see. \n\nIf I multiply both numerator and denominator by 8, then the denominator becomes 1250 * 8 = 10000, which is 10^4. Let's check: 1250 * 8 = 10000. Yes, because 125 * 8 = 1000, so 1250 * 8 = 10000. So, if I multiply numerator and denominator by 8, the fraction becomes (3*8)/(1250*8) = 24/10000. Then, 24 divided by 10000 is 0.0024. So, that would be the decimal representation. \n\nWait, let's confirm that. 24 divided by 10000: 24/10000 is 0.0024. Because 24 divided by 10 is 2.4, divided by 100 is 0.24, divided by 1000 is 0.024, divided by 10000 is 0.0024. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, 3/1250 as a decimal is 0.0024. Now, the question is asking how many zeros are between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. Let's look at 0.0024. The decimal point is followed by two zeros, then the first non-zero digit is 2. So between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (which is 2), there are two zeros. So the answer should be 2. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's try another approach. Let's divide 3 by 1250 manually. \n\nSo, 3 \u00f7 1250. Let's see. Since 1250 goes into 3.0000... How many times does 1250 go into 3? Zero times. Then we add a decimal point and some zeros. 1250 goes into 30 zero times, into 300 zero times, into 3000 two times because 1250 * 2 = 2500. Subtract 2500 from 3000, we get 500. Bring down the next zero to make 5000. 1250 goes into 5000 four times (1250 * 4 = 5000). Subtract that, we get 0. So the division gives 0.0024. Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, the decimal is indeed 0.0024. So between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (which is the 2 in the thousandths place), there are two zeros. So the number of zeros is 2. \n\nWait, but let's visualize the decimal places. The first place after the decimal is tenths, then hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths. So 0.0024 is 0 in tenths, 0 in hundredths, 2 in thousandths, and 4 in ten-thousandths. So the first non-zero digit is in the thousandths place, which is two places after the decimal. Wait, but the tenths is first, hundredths second, thousandths third. Wait, no, tenths (1st), hundredths (2nd), thousandths (3rd), ten-thousandths (4th). So 0.0024 has:\n\n- 0 in tenths (1st),\n- 0 in hundredths (2nd),\n- 2 in thousandths (3rd),\n- 4 in ten-thousandths (4th).\n\nSo the first non-zero digit is in the third decimal place. Therefore, there are two zeros after the decimal point before the first non-zero digit. Therefore, the answer is 2. \n\nBut hold on, maybe I need to check once more. Let me write out 0.0024. After the decimal, it's 0, 0, 2, 4. So between the decimal point and the first 2, there are two zeros. So two zeros. So yes, the answer is 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to compute this without converting the fraction. For example, using exponents. Since 1250 is 10^4 / 8, as we saw earlier, but maybe that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, using logarithms? Hmm, maybe not necessary here. Since we already have two methods leading to the same answer, and the decimal representation is confirmed, I think we can be confident that the number of zeros is 2. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about another method. Let's express 3/1250 as a decimal by simplifying the fraction first. 3/1250. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2 first. 3/1250 = (3/2)/625. But 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, so 1.5/625. Then, 1.5 divided by 625. Let's do that division. \n\n1.5 \u00f7 625. Well, 625 goes into 1.5 zero times. So we write 0. and then proceed. 625 goes into 15 (after adding a zero) zero times. 625 goes into 150 (another zero) still zero times. 625 goes into 1500 two times (since 625*2=1250). Subtract 1250 from 1500, get 250. Bring down the next zero, making 2500. 625 goes into 2500 four times (625*4=2500). So we have 0.0024. Same result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the decimal is 0.0024, so two zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. \n\nAnother approach: Express the denominator as 10^n * something. Since 1250 = 10^3 * 1.25. Therefore, 3/1250 = 3/(10^3 * 1.25) = (3/1.25)/10^3. 3 divided by 1.25. Let's compute 3 \u00f7 1.25. 1.25 goes into 3 two times (1.25*2=2.50). Subtract 2.50 from 3, we get 0.50. Bring down a zero, making it 5.0. 1.25 goes into 5.0 four times (1.25*4=5.00). So 3 \u00f7 1.25 = 2.4. Then divide by 10^3 (which is 1000), so 2.4 \u00f7 1000 = 0.0024. Again, same result. \n\nYep, so this method also gives 0.0024, confirming the number of zeros is two. \n\nI think that's thorough enough. All methods lead to the decimal 0.0024, so two zeros between the decimal and the first non-zero digit. Therefore, the answer should be 2.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit when \\(\\frac{3}{1250}\\) is written as a decimal, we can convert the fraction to its decimal form.\n\n1. **Factor the denominator**:  \n   \\(1250 = 5^4 \\times 2\\).\n\n2. **Convert the denominator to a power of 10**:  \n   Multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\(8\\) to get:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 \\times 8}{1250 \\times 8} = \\frac{24}{10000}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction**:  \n   \\(\\frac{24}{10000} = 0.0024\\).\n\n4. **Analyze the decimal representation**:  \n   The decimal \\(0.0024\\) has two zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (which is \\(2\\)).\n\nThus, the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).", "role": "assistant"}], "applied_functions": "identity", "num_chars": 6867}

In this case, the fraction is 3 over 1250. *So* maybe I can do the division 3 \u00f7 1250. *But* before jumping into long division, maybe there's a smarter way to simplify this or convert the denominator to a power of 10 to make it easier?\n\n*Wait*, the denominator here is 1250. Let me break that down. 1250 is 125 times 10, right? And 125 is 5 cubed (5^3). *So* 1250 is 5^3 * 2 * 5, which is 5^4 * 2. *Hmm*, or maybe I should factor it as 1250 = 5^4 * 2. Let me confirm: 5^3 is 125, times 10 is 1250. *So*, 5^3 * 10 = 1250. *Alternatively*, 1250 = 125 * 10 = 5^3 * 2 * 5 = 5^4 * 2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\n*So*, since the denominator is 5^4 * 2, to convert the fraction to a decimal, we might need to make the denominator a power of 10. Powers of 10 are multiples of 2 and 5. Since 1250 is 5^4 * 2, if we can get the denominator to be 10^4, we can have a decimal. *Wait*, *but* 10^4 is 10000. Let me see. \n\nIf I multiply both numerator and denominator by 8, *then* the denominator becomes 1250 * 8 = 10000, which is 10^4. Let's check: 1250 * 8 = 10000. *Yes*, because 125 * 8 = 1000, *so* 1250 * 8 = 10000. *So*, if I multiply numerator and denominator by 8, the fraction becomes (3*8)/(1250*8) = 24/10000. *Then*, 24 divided by 10000 is 0.0024. *So*, that would be the decimal representation. \n\n*Wait*, let's confirm that. 24 divided by 10000: 24/10000 is 0.0024. Because 24 divided by 10 is 2.4, divided by 100 is 0.24, divided by 1000 is 0.024, divided by 10000 is 0.0024. *So* *yes*, that's correct. \n\n*Therefore*, 3/1250 as a decimal is 0.0024. *Now*, the question is asking how many zeros are between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. Let's look at 0.0024. The decimal point is followed by two zeros, *then* the first non-zero digit is 2. *So* between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (which is 2), there are two zeros. *So* the answer should be 2. \n\n*But* *wait*, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's try another approach. Let's divide 3 by 1250 manually. \n\n*So*, 3 \u00f7 1250. Let's see. Since 1250 goes into 3.0000... How many times does 1250 go into 3? Zero times. *Then* we add a decimal point and some zeros. 1250 goes into 30 zero times, into 300 zero times, into 3000 two times because 1250 * 2 = 2500. Subtract 2500 from 3000, we get 500. Bring down the next zero to make 5000. 1250 goes into 5000 four times (1250 * 4 = 5000). Subtract that, we get 0. *So* the division gives 0.0024. Yep, same result. \n\n*Therefore*, the decimal is indeed 0.0024. *So* between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (which is the 2 in the thousandths place), there are two zeros. *So* the number of zeros is 2. \n\n*Wait*, *but* let's visualize the decimal places. The first place after the decimal is tenths, *then* hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths. *So* 0.0024 is 0 in tenths, 0 in hundredths, 2 in thousandths, and 4 in ten-thousandths. *So* the first non-zero digit is in the thousandths place, which is two places after the decimal. *Wait*, *but* the tenths is first, hundredths second, thousandths third. *Wait*, no, tenths (1st), hundredths (2nd), thousandths (3rd), ten-thousandths (4th). *So* 0.0024 has:\n\n- 0 in tenths (1st),\n- 0 in hundredths (2nd),\n- 2 in thousandths (3rd),\n- 4 in ten-thousandths (4th).\n\n*So* the first non-zero digit is in the third decimal place. *Therefore*, there are two zeros after the decimal point before the first non-zero digit. *Therefore*, the answer is 2. \n\n*But* hold on, maybe I need to check once more. Let me write out 0.0024. After the decimal, it's 0, 0, 2, 4. *So* between the decimal point and the first 2, there are two zeros. *So* two zeros. *So* *yes*, the answer is 2. \n\n*Alternatively*, perhaps there's another way to compute this without converting the fraction. For example, using exponents. Since 1250 is 10^4 / 8, as we saw earlier, *but* maybe that complicates things. \n\n*Alternatively*, using logarithms? *Hmm*, maybe not necessary here. Since we already have two methods leading to the same answer, and the decimal representation is confirmed, I think we can be confident that the number of zeros is 2. \n\n*But* just to be thorough, let's think about another method. Let's express 3/1250 as a decimal by simplifying the fraction first. 3/1250. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2 first. 3/1250 = (3/2)/625. *But* 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, *so* 1.5/625. *Then*, 1.5 divided by 625. Let's do that division. \n\n1.5 \u00f7 625. Well, 625 goes into 1.5 zero times. *So* we write 0. and *then* proceed. 625 goes into 15 (after adding a zero) zero times. 625 goes into 150 (another zero) still zero times. 625 goes into 1500 two times (since 625*2=1250). Subtract 1250 from 1500, get 250. Bring down the next zero, making 2500. 625 goes into 2500 four times (625*4=2500). *So* we have 0.0024. Same result. \n\n*Therefore*, regardless of the method, the decimal is 0.0024, *so* two zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. \n\nAnother approach: Express the denominator as 10^n * something. Since 1250 = 10^3 * 1.25. *Therefore*, 3/1250 = 3/(10^3 * 1.25) = (3/1.25)/10^3. 3 divided by 1.25. Let's compute 3 \u00f7 1.25. 1.25 goes into 3 two times (1.25*2=2.50). Subtract 2.50 from 3, we get 0.50. Bring down a zero, making it 5.0. 1.25 goes into 5.0 four times (1.25*4=5.00). *So* 3 \u00f7 1.25 = 2.4. *Then* divide by 10^3 (which is 1000), *so* 2.4 \u00f7 1000 = 0.0024. *Again*, same result. \n\nYep, *so* this method also gives 0.0024, confirming the number of zeros is two. \n\nI think that's thorough enough.

Let'S Express 3/1250 As A Decimal By Simplifying The Fraction First. 3/1250. Let'S Divide Numerator And Denominator By 2 First. 3/1250 = (3/2)/625. But 3 Divided By 2 Is 1.5, So 1.5/625. Then, 1.5 Divided By 625. Let'S Do That Division. \n\n1.5 \u00f7 625. Well, 625 Goes Into 1.5 Zero Times. So We Write 0. And Then Proceed. 625 Goes Into 15 (After Adding A Zero) Zero Times. 625 Goes Into 150 (Another Zero) Still Zero Times. 625 Goes Into 1500 Two Times (Since 625*2=1250). Subtract 1250 From 1500, Get 250. Bring Down The Next Zero, Making 2500. 625 Goes Into 2500 Four Times (625*4=2500). So We Have 0.0024. Same Result. \n\nTherefore, Regardless Of The Method, The Decimal Is 0.0024, So Two Zeros Between The Decimal Point And The First Non-Zero Digit. \n\nAnother Approach: Express The Denominator As 10^N * Something. Since 1250 = 10^3 * 1.25. Therefore, 3/1250 = 3/(10^3 * 1.25) = (3/1.25)/10^3. 3 Divided By 1.25. Let'S Compute 3 \u00f7 1.25. 1.25 Goes Into 3 Two Times (1.25*2=2.50). Subtract 2.50 From 3, We Get 0.50. Bring Down A Zero, Making It 5.0. 1.25 Goes Into 5.0 Four Times (1.25*4=5.00). So 3 \u00f7 1.25 = 2.4. Then Divide By 10^3 (Which Is 1000), So 2.4 \u00f7 1000 = 0.0024. Again, Same Result. \n\nYep, So This Method Also Gives 0.0024, Confirming The Number Of Zeros Is Two. \n\nI Think That'S Thorough Enough. All Methods Lead To The Decimal 0.0024, So Two Zeros Between The Decimal And The First Non-Zero Digit.

The radii are 14 inches and 4 inches, and the distance between the points where the belt touches the pulleys is 24 inches. I need to find the distance between the centers of the pulleys. The answer choices are given, so that might help if I get stuck, but I should try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There are two circles (pulleys) with different radii. The belt is wrapped around them without crossing, which means it's an open belt drive, not a crossed belt drive. The distance between the points where the belt touches the pulleys is 24 inches. Hmm, wait, the points of contact\u2014so that would be the two points where the belt just starts to leave each pulley? Since the belt is tangent to both pulleys, right? So the distance between these two tangent points is 24 inches. But the actual centers of the pulleys aren't 24 inches apart; I need to relate that 24 inches to the distance between centers.\n\nLet me recall that in belt drive problems, the length of the belt can be calculated if you know the distance between centers and the radii of the pulleys. But here, instead of the belt length, they give the distance between the points of contact. Maybe I need to use similar triangles or some right triangles here.\n\nLet me sketch a diagram mentally. There are two circles with centers O1 and O2, radii r1 = 14 and r2 = 4. The belt is an external tangent to both circles. The points of contact are T1 on the first pulley and T2 on the second. The distance between T1 and T2 is 24 inches. The line connecting O1 and O2 is the distance we need to find, let's call it D.\n\nIn such a configuration, the line connecting the centers (O1O2) and the two tangent lines (T1T2) form a trapezoid. The distance between the centers D can be found using the Pythagorean theorem if we consider the difference in radii and the length of the common external tangent.\n\nWait, yes! For two circles with radii r1 and r2, the length of the external tangent between them is given by sqrt(D^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). Wait, no, actually, the formula is sqrt(D^2 - (r1 + r2)^2) for internal tangent and sqrt(D^2 - (r1 - r2)^2) for external tangent. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nThe length of the external tangent (which is the case here, since the belt is not crossed) between two circles is sqrt(D^2 - (r1 - r2)^2), where D is the distance between centers. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up.\n\nLet me recall the formula correctly. The length of the external tangent between two circles is sqrt(D^2 - (r1 + r2)^2) if it's an internal tangent? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If the circles are apart, the external tangent would form a right triangle with sides (r1 - r2) and the tangent length, hypotenuse D. Wait, maybe.\n\nWait, when you have two circles, the external tangent doesn't pass between the circles, it's outside. So if you connect the centers, and then draw the external tangent, the distance between the two tangent points (the length of the external tangent) can be calculated using similar triangles or right triangles.\n\nSuppose we have two circles with centers O1 and O2, radii r1 and r2. The external tangent lines will touch each circle at points T1 and T2. The lines O1T1 and O2T2 are radii and are perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, the quadrilateral O1T1T2O2 is a trapezoid with O1T1 perpendicular to T1T2 and O2T2 perpendicular to T1T2. Therefore, the lines O1T1 and O2T2 are both perpendicular to the same line, meaning they are parallel to each other.\n\nTherefore, the distance between O1 and O2 can be found by considering the right triangle formed by O1, O2, and the projection of O2 onto the line O1T1. The difference in radii is r1 - r2 = 14 - 4 = 10 inches. The length of the external tangent is 24 inches. So the distance between centers D should satisfy:\n\nD^2 = (r1 - r2)^2 + (length of tangent)^2\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, if the two radii are perpendicular to the tangent, then the lines O1T1 and O2T2 are both perpendicular to T1T2, which is the tangent. So the distance between O1 and O2 is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the length of the external tangent (24 inches) and the other leg is the difference in radii (14 - 4 = 10 inches). Therefore, D = sqrt(24^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(576 + 100) = sqrt(676) = 26 inches. So the answer is D) 26.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes I might mix up internal and external tangents. For internal tangent (crossed belt), the formula would involve the sum of radii, but for external tangent (open belt), it's the difference. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nImagine we have two circles, radii r1 and r2, centers separated by D. The length of the external tangent between them is L = sqrt(D^2 - (r1 - r2)^2). Wait, so if the length of the tangent is given as 24, then 24 = sqrt(D^2 - (14 - 4)^2). Then, solving for D:\n\n24 = sqrt(D^2 - 100)\n\n24^2 = D^2 - 100\n\n576 = D^2 - 100\n\nD^2 = 676\n\nD = sqrt(676) = 26.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the distance between the centers is 26 inches, which is option D. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the line connecting the centers, O1O2, which is length D. The line connecting the points of contact, T1T2, is the external tangent of length 24. The radii O1T1 and O2T2 are perpendicular to T1T2, so the angle between O1O2 and the line connecting O1 to the projection of O2 onto T1T2 is a right angle.\n\nWait, actually, if we consider the line connecting the centers, O1O2, and the two radii O1T1 and O2T2, which are both perpendicular to the tangent T1T2, then the triangle formed by O1, O2, and the point where a line from O2 parallel to T1T2 meets O1T1 is a right triangle. The horizontal leg would be the difference in radii, 10 inches, and the vertical leg is the length of the tangent, 24 inches. Therefore, the hypotenuse is D = sqrt(10^2 + 24^2) = sqrt(100 + 576) = sqrt(676) = 26. So yes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 26. Let me check the answer options: A)24, B)2\u221a119 \u2248 21.8, C)25, D)26, E)4\u221a35 \u224823.66. So 26 is an option, D. That must be the correct answer.\n\nI think that makes sense. The key was remembering the formula for the length of the external tangent between two circles, which uses the difference of the radii. Then setting up the right triangle and solving for D. The given distance between the points of contact (24 inches) is the length of the external tangent, so plugging that into the formula gives D = 26. Yep, that all checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the distance between the centers of the pulleys, we start by noting that the belt forms an external tangent to both pulleys.
